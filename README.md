Bash script file that will install all the necessary packages using pacman and will uncomment [multilibs] and install xfce4 DE with xfce4-goodies and other packages including discord, steam, git, neofetch, alacritty, firefox.
it will also install an AUR and clone it into home which is paru repo and will install spotify.


This is a script I made personally for myself but I wanted to share it to others so it can be useful.

This repo is open-source and anyone can publish it anywhere and change things in it.
